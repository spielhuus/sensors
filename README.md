# IoT Sensors

In this Project some IoT Sensors and actors are created. The goal is it to build low energy and cost efficient modules Depending

Various IoT Sensors using Wi-Fi or Lora.

# Sensor Projects

## Attiny/LoraWan Temperature and CO2 Sensor 

## Attmega328 Multi Sensor Board

The Atmega 328 Board has connector to different sesnsors. The collected data is uloaded to the things network.
